### Running the build
All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.

| Npm Script | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`                   | Runs full build and runs node on dist/index.js. Can be invoked with `npm start`                  |
| `build:copy`                   | copy the *.yaml file to dist/ folder      |
| `build:live`                   | Full build. Runs ALL build tasks       |
| `build:dev`                   | Full build. Runs ALL build tasks with all watch tasks        |
| `dev`                   | Runs full build before starting all watch tasks. Can be invoked with `npm dev`                                         |
| `test`                    | Runs build and run tests using mocha        |
| `lint`                    | Runs TSLint on project files       |


# Common Issues

## npm install fails
The current solution has an example for using a private npm repository. if you want to use the public npm repository, remove the .npmrc file.
